Data Translators
================

.. note::

  ``Translators`` in ``pycroscopy`` will eventually be replaced by ``sidpy.Reader`` classes
  which only extract information from instrument-specific data files and will not write data into any data files, unlike ``Translator`` classes.

  The new ``Reader`` classes will be hosted in the ``ScopeReaders`` package instead of ``pycroscopy``.

* Pycroscopy uses ``Translators`` to extract data and metadata from files (often measurement data stored in instrument-generated proprietary file formats) and write them into `Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID) HDF5 files <../../USID/index.html>`_.
* You can write your own ``Translator`` easily by following `this example <https://pycroscopy.github.io/pyUSID/auto_examples/beginner/plot_numpy_translator.html>`_ on our sister project's documentation.
* Below is a list of ``Translators`` already available in pycroscopy to translate data.
* These translators can be accessed via ``pycroscopy.io.translators`` or ``pycroscopy.translators``
* We tend to add new ``Translators`` to this list frequently.

  * We understand that this list does not (yet) comprehensively cover all modalities and instrument manufacturers, but we are working towards a comprehensive set of translators.
  * We only have access to a small subset of all available instruments and data which limits our ability to add more translators.
  * Given that this is a **community-driven effort**, you can help by providing:

    * Example datasets (scans, force curves, spectra, force-maps, spectra acquired on grids of locations, etc.)
    * Links to existing packages that have figured out how to extract this data. (More often than not, there are researchers who have put up their code)
    * Your own code for extracting data. We invite you to come onboard and add your tools to the package.
    * Guidance in correctly extracting the metadata (parameters) and data
    * Your time. We are interested in collaborating with you to develop translators.
* We are also interested in collaborating with instrument manufacturers to integrate pycroscopy into instrumentation or analysis software.

Quick example
--------------------
Let's translate an Igor Binaray Wave (ibw) file to a USID h5 file, and inspect the contents. Only the translator changes for different file formats, all other steps should remain the same.

.. code:: python

 import h5py
 import pyUSID as usid
 import pycroscopy as px

 #path to file you wish to translate 
 file_path = r'/my_folder/a10.sxm'

 #Do the translation
 translator = px.io.translators.NanonisTranslator() #Instantiating translator.
 #Note: Change translator depending on your input file format
 
 h5_path = translator.translate(file_path) #translates, and then returns path of translated file

 #Open the translated file
 h5_f = h5py.File(h5_path, 'r+')

 #Inspect the h5 file
 usid.hdf_utils.print_tree(h5_f)

 #Get all the main datasets
 main_dsets = usid.hdf_utils.get_all_main(h5_f)

 #Print out the list of main datasets
 print(main_dsets)
